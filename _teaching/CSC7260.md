The next-generation hybrid cloud platform is integrated with Network Functions (NFs) across diverse network environments, ushering in a new computing paradigm known as in-network computing (INC). This introductory course on INC offers system and network engineers the opportunity to engage in large-scale system optimization. Participants will learn practical data plane programming skills, gain hands-on experience in hardware programming using software techniques, and explore real-world applications through case studies in data centers, distributed AI/ML systems, security, and more.
