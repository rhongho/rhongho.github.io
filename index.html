      <p>I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~mohaisen/">Prof. David Mohaisen</a>. I would like to also thank my advisor at Inha, <a href="http://seclab.ewha.ac.kr/">Prof. DaeHun Nyang</a> (Now, Ewha Womans University), for his endless support. Dr. Nyang and Dr. Mohaisen saw the potential in me early on and shaped me for success in researching and publishing scholarly work.</p>
        <!-- Rhongho Jang is a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida (Advisor: Prof. David Mohaisen). He earned his B.S. and M.Sc. degrees from INHA University of South Korea in 2013 and 2015, as well as a PhD in 2020 (Advisor: Prof. Daehun Nyang), while concurrently enrolling at the University of Central Florida. --><!-- Rhongho Jang earned his B.S. and M.Sc. degrees from INHA University of South Korea in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Currently, he is enrolling in a Ph.D. dual-degree agreement program established between INHA University and the University of Central Florida (UCF). At the end of his Ph.D. study, he will receive Ph.D. degrees from both INHA and UCF. As of now, he has successfully defended his dissertation at INHA University and will defend his UCF dissertation soon. --></p>
