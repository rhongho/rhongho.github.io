				<h1 class="page-heading">Professional Bio</h1>
				<p>I'm a tenure-track assistant professor in the department of computer science at Wayne State University. I joined Wayne State University in Fall 2020. Before joining Wayne, I was a Ph.D student in the department of computer science at the University of Central Florida. To date, I published as a lead author several peer-reviewed research papers, including papers in top-tier conferences and premier journals, such as IEEE ICDCS, IEEE INFOCOM, and IEEE TMC, etc. I won the Best-in-session Presentation Award (SDN II) at IEEE INFOCOM (2017), the Outstanding Young Researcher Award from KISA (2018).</p>

				<p>I'm looking for energetic and motivated Ph.D. students to join my group. If interested, send me your CV and transcripts, and apply.</p>

				<h1 class="page-heading">Recent Research Areas and Interests</h1>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Network Traffic Measurement</b>: I'm interested in designing a cost-efficient data structure and algorithm (<i>i.e.</i>, sketch) to realize the fast and accurate traffic measurement in a high-speed and resource-constraint network environment [INFOCOM'17][WiSec'17][ICDCS'19]. </li>
    
    				<li><b>Wireless Security</b>: I'm interested in studying the wireless secuirty inlcuding rogue access point detection [ICDCS'19], SDN-based WLAN intrusion detection system [INFOCOM'17], and channel interference [TMC'20].
    
    				<li><b>Sampling Algorithm</b>: In this project, we introduce a new concept of per-flow systematic sampling, aiming to provide the same sampling rate across all flows. In addition, we provide a concrete sampling method called SketchFlow, which approximates the idea of the per-flow systematic sampling using a sketch saturation event. We demonstrate SketchFlow’s performance in terms of accuracy, sampling rate, and overhead using real-world datasets. Experimental results show that SketchFlow outperforms SRS (i.e., sFlow) and the non-linear sampling method while requiring a small CPU overhead to measure high-speed traffic in real-time [INFOCOM'20].</li>
    
					<li><b>Privacy</b>: In this work, we conduct in-depth analyses of two state-of-the-art WF defense approaches of The Onion Router (Tor). Then, based on our new insights, we propose a novel defense mechanism using a per-burst injection technique, called Deep Fingerprinting Defender (DFD), which is designed to break the inherent patterns preserved in Tor user's traces by carefully injecting dummy packets within every burst [INFOCOM'20].
